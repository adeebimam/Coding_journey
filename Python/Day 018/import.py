"""
Python in itself has a lot of modules that can be imported and used in our code, 
most of them are very common ones such as the turtle module.

But if we are looking to use a module that is not a part of the standard library, 
we can install it using pip or install it from the website of the module.

from turtle import Turtle as t #We can use this method to import something and name it something else,
                               #as I have named my turtle as t

from turtle import * #This will import everything from the turtle module, this is not recommended as it can cause
                        #name conflicts and confusion
